# Contributing to [Hydra](https://github.com/sky-uk/hydra-terraform)

We greatly appreciate and encourage people contributing back into the Hydra project.

## Code Formatting

We strictly follow the code formatting for HCL specified by Hashicorp. You can easily format all the code to match this by running `terraform fmt` from your command line.

There is a CI check that will fail should the code not be correctly formatted.

## Contributions

We greatly appreciate all contributions to this project. Please take a look through the following considerations

- [] Does my contribution extend the functionality in a generic, re-usable way
- [] Could my contribution be better used by the consumer as an additional module after hydra has built?

## Creating Issues

Submit issues to the issue tracker on this repository for suggestions, recommendations, and bugs.

When submitting issues, please make sure you utilise the template provided by default and include as much information as possible.

Please note: If it’s an issue that’s urgent / you feel you can fix yourself, please feel free to make some changes and submit a pull request. We’d love to see your contributions.

## Pull Requests

PRs should be from a forked project with an appropriate branch name and should be narrowly focused with no more than 3 or 4 logical commits. When possible, a PR should address no more than one issue and should be reviewable in the GitHub code review tool. Please link to any issues to which it relates (i.e. issue number after (#) in commit messages or pull request message).

Please expect a thorough review process for any pull requests that add functionality or change the behaviour of the application. We encourage you to sketch your approach in writing on a relevant issue (or creating such an issue if needed) before starting to code, in order to save time and facilitate communication.
